Air China 747-8 By E-Savageair

Background:

Air China, owned by China National Aviation Corporation is national airline of 
the People's Republic of China.  The airline commenced operations on July 1, 
1988 as a result of the government's decision to split the Civil Aviation 
Administration of China (CAAC) into six separate airlines: Air China, China 
Eastern, China Southern, China Northern, China Southwest, and China Northwest.  
Air China takes over the chief responsibility of long-haul flights and aircraft 
that once belonged to CAAC.  The operation hub is out Beijing Capital 
International Airport.

Air China has always owned 747's including the 747-100, and the 'SP' models 
while operating as the CAAC.  In March 2011, Air China signed an agreement with 
Boeing to order five 747-8's and to begin service in 2014.  So far they're on 
schedule: the first 747-8i for Air China, B-2485 the livery deplicted here took 
to the sky on July 31, 2014 with two other '8s' nearing completion down the 
assembly line.

The Phoenix logo on the tail of Air China aircraft is an artistic play on the 
word "VIP" Air China is a member of the Star Alliance.
