  <!--Lufthansa 747-8i Retro livery by E-Savageair

   Background:

     The original Lufthansa can be traced back to 1926 when Deutsche Lufth Hansa A.G. was formed in Berin through the merger 
  with Junkers Flugzeug- und Motorenwerke AG (JFM) which had it's own airline, Lufthverkehr AG.  The name was believed to have orginated 
  from a book entitled "Luft-Hansa", published by F.A. Fisher von Puturzyn. The logo design, a stylized crane in a circle was created 
  by Otto Firle for first the German airline, Deutsche Luft-Reederei in 1918 starting operatons on Febuary 5, 1919. The name Lufthansa 
  comes from the German word luft or "air" and hansa, meaning "guild". 

     The new Lutfhansa operated from Berin till flights were suspended following the defeat of Germany in 1945. On Jan. 6, 1953, 
  a new national airline named Luftag was formed in the city of Cologne. Not knowing if they had sovereignty over their airspace and 
  many of the staff having worked for the pre-war Lutfhansa, the new national airline ordered four Convair CV-340's and Lockheed L-1049
  Super Constellations, then they set up a maintenance base at Hamburg Airport.  On August 6, 1954, Luftag acquired the name and the 
  logo from the old liquidated Deutsche Lufthansa for DM 30,000 (That's e68000 in today's currency), continuing the tradition of 
  the German flag carrier name.  

     On April 1, 1955 Lutfhansa was approved for domestic flights to Hamburg, Dusseldorf, Cologne, and Munich.  On May 15, 1955 they
  began international flights to London, Paris, and Madrid.  On June 1, Lufthansa started Super Constellation flights to New York, followed
  by flights to Canada, South Amereica, Tehran, and Baghdad.  But because of it's then special status in being a part of the Division
  of Germany, Lufthansa couldn't fly into either part of Berin until 1989. In 1955, East Germany tried to establish their own "Lufthansa" 
  airline, but ran into a legal dispute in using the name since Lufthansa was based in West Germany.  So in 1963, East Germany established 
  Interflug as its national airline, shutting down the East German Lufthansa. 

     Going into the 60's Lufthansa would follow the same path of other airlines in purchasing jetliners such as the Boeing 707 to its fleet.
  In 1958 Lufthansa ordered four Boeing 707s and started jet flights from Frankfurt to New York City in March 1960.  Then Lufthansa became 
  the launch customer for the Boeing 737 on February 19, 1965, with an order for 21 aircraft, becoming the first foreign launch customer 
  for a Boeing airliner.  In the 70's a new buzzword becomes a part of the commercial airline lexicon: Jumbo Jet.The wide-body era came to 
  Lufthansa on April 26, 1970 with the introduction of the Boeing 747; on November 12, 1973 The McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 joined the fleet.  
  In 1976 they included the first A300 by Airbus Industries.  Then later in 1979 both Lufthansa and Swissair were launch customers for the A310.  
  For the 90's the company began a fleet modernization program starting on June 30, 1985. The new fleet included Airbus A320's, A300-600's,
  A340's, Boeing 737-300 and the Boeing 747-400.  On Decemeber 6, 2006, Lufthansa became the launch customer for the Boeing 747-8i ordering 20 
  of the type; the 747-8i went into service in 2012. Among the purchased 747-8i's was aircraft D-ABYT.  She took to the sky on February, 14 2015. 
  But instead of flying in the current all-white fuselage and big bold fonts, she's painted in the retro livery of the 70's featuring 
  the blue cheatline. This is the aircraft livery being deplicted.

     
     Since 1953 Lufthansa has flown to 18 domestic destinations and 197 international destinations in 78 countries across Africa, the Amereicas,
  Asia, and Europe, using a fleet of more than 280 aircraft; overall the airline that also parents Swiss international Airlines, Austrian Airlines, 
  Germanwings, and Lufthansa Techink operates a total of over 620 aircraft and carrying over 103 million passengers, giving Lufthansa one of the
  largest of fleet aircraft in the world as a total group.  

     Lufthansa is one of the five founding members of the Star Alliance, the world's biggest airline alliance; the corporate headquarters still 
  originates in Colonge.
