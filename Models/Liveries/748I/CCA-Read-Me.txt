Air China 747-8 By E-Savageair

Background:

     Air China, owned by China National Aviation Corporation is national airline of the People's 
Republic of China.  The airline commenced operations on July 1 1988 as a result of the 
government's decision to split the Civil Aviation Adiministration of China (CAAC) into six 
separate airlines: Air China, China Eastern, China Southern, China Northern, China Southwest, 
and China Northwest.  Air China takes over the chief responsibility of long-haul flights and 
aircraft that once belonged to CAAC.  The operation hub is out Beijing Capital International 
Airport.

     Air China has always owned 747's including the 747-100, and the 'SP' models while operating
as the CAAC.  In March 2011, Air China signed an agreement with Boeing to order five 787-8's and
to begin service in 2014.  So far they're on schedule: the first 747-8i for Air China, B-2485 the 
livery deplicted here took to the sky on July 31, 2014 with two other '8s' nearing completion
down the assembly line.

     The Phoenix logo on the tail of Air China aircraft is an artistic play on the word
"VIP" Air China is a member of the Star Alliance.
