Cathay Pacific Cargo 748 livery by E-Savageair

It all began on Sept. 24, 1946 an American, Roy C. Ferrell and an Australian 
Sydney de Kantzow, both ex-air force pilots put up $1 in Hong Kong Money to 
register a new airline.  It would be called Cathay Pacific Airways.  According 
to legend, the name was conceived by Farrell and correspondents at a bar in the 
Manila Hotel, in the Philippines.  The name "Cathay" came from China as 
"Khitan" and "Pacific" to mean that according to Farrell, they would one day 
fly across the Pacific (that would eventually happen in the '70s.)  The Chinese 
name for the company comes from the Chinese idiom "Grand and Peaceful State."  

In 1948, Butterfield and Swire (Now known as Swire Group) Bought 45% of the new 
airline, Australian National Airways taking 35% with Farrell and de Kantzow 
taking 10% of their new airline.  

The first flight began on July 1, 1948 with a DC-3 nicknamed "Betsy," flying 
routes from Hong Kong, Manila, and on to Singapore, Shanghai, Canton, and 
Sydney.  They would then acquire a second DC-3 aircraft they would name 
"Niki."  

Cathay Pacific would expand in the '60s through the '80s; in 1979 they would 
buy their first 747, the first of many.  They would go on to be one of the 
biggest operators of the type.  

By the mid '80s CP's destinations would include North American routes flying 
into San Francisco and Vancouver, Canada. Today Cathay Pacific serves 168 
destinations in 42 countries on five continents, with a well-developed Asian 
network.  The airline connects to many cites around the world through One world 
and codeshare partners, American Airlines and British Airways, and with French 
national rail operator SNCF, from Paris; they also have access to 17 
destinations in China with its subsidiary, Dragonair.

In 1994, CX introduced the "brushwing" livery that's depicted here, which 
featured the calligraphic stroke against a green background on the vertical 
stabilizer vs. the older green and white striping with the British flag on the 
corner of the tail fin; on the fuselage is white on the top half of the 
aircraft with the powder-blue striping in the middle of the fuselage and a 
lower shade of white near the bottom.  Near the top on upper deck are the 
brandlines, "Asia's world city" and the "Hong Kong" brand logo.
